<h3>Programming Languages, Tools and software (IDEs) used for Project implementation: </h3>
<h4>Programming Languages:-</h4>

| 1       | nodeJS                     | 8.17.0     | We need nodeJS to run our backend application. We also need nodeJS to run node package manager (npm).|
| 2       | git bash                   | 2.27.0.    | It has multiple uses depends upon us dealing with github such as clone can be done using git bash. Furthermore, we can also run our back-end and front using Git Bash.|
| 3       | visual studio code         | 1.47.3     | We use Visual studio (VS) Code to write our JS code. We can also use VS code<br /> (ctrl + ~) terminal to get some services which git bash provides.|

<h3>Project Configuration Guidelines (Step by Step):</h3>

1. **Step 1:**  Install nodejs (8.17.0) from https://nodejs.org/en/
 
2. **Step 2:**  Install Git Bash  (2.27.0.windows.1)  from https://git-scm.com/download/win (it is optional in this case as requirements can be fulfilled manually by other platforms; preferable to install for convenience).
 
3.	**Step3:** Install visual studio code (1.47.3)
 
4.	**Step4:** Clone the repository from https://github.com/zahidalidev/CS311S20PID25.git using any of your convenient tool.

5.	**Step5(method#1):** Go to “timeTableBackend” from the repository you have cloned and open git bash here and run command “node index.js” then in the response you will see message “listening on port 5000” it means backend is running.<br>
   **Step5 (method#2):** Go to “timeTableBackend”  from the repository you have cloned  and open with visual studio here and press ctrl + ~ and run command “node index.js” then in the response you will see message “listening on port 5000” its mean backend is running.

6.	**Step6(method#1):** Go to “timetable_frontend” from the repository you have cloned and open git bash here and run command “npm start”, in the response frontend application will start running on “http://localhost:3000/” (browser) on port in 3000 in a while so now both front-end and backend are running.<br>
   **Step6(method#2):**  Go to “timetable_frontend”  from the repository you have cloned  and open with visual studio here and press ctrl + ~ and run command “npm start” then in the response frontend application will start running on “http://localhost:3000/” (browser) on port in 3000 in a while so now both front-end and backend are running.
